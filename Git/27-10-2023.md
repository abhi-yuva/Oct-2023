## Git Cont...

### Git Branches
- Branch is nothing but a new/copy of the base branch in your repository
- Branches will contain the information from where commit is created
- And that particular commit will have the information of all the parent commits
- The new commits from the base branch will not be reflected in your feature branch untill you pull all the latest changes manually
- It is recommended to pull the changes from the base branch before merging your changes into the base branch
- The vice versa is not possible to pull the changes of feature branch in base branch
- You have an option to merge your changes from feature branch to the base branch or in any another branch with the help of `merge` command
- Here is the command to create a branch in git
```
git branch <branch-name>
```
- Once you create a new branch, to move to the newly created branch you have to type the below command
```
git checkout <branch-name>
```
- Below is the scenario how it looks
```
$ git branch -a
* master


$ git log --oneline
f6f56e8 (HEAD -> master) Mixed Reset
4154632 Added a new line
f915c7e Created a new file in Repo


$ git branch feature/abhi-test


$ git branch -a
  feature/abhi-test
* master


$ git checkout feature/abhi-test 
Switched to branch 'feature/abhi-test'

$ git branch -a
* feature/abhi-test
  master

$ git log --oneline 
f6f56e8 (HEAD -> feature/abhi-test, master) Mixed Reset
4154632 Added a new line
f915c7e Created a new file in Repo
```
- After Creation of new commits in feature branch and the base branch
- The below table show you the difference

|Base Branch | Feature Branch |
|------------| --------------- |
| $ git log --oneline | $ git log --oneline |
| f6f56e8 (HEAD -> master) Mixed Reset | 7841e52 (HEAD -> feature/abhi-test) This commit is in feature branch |
| 4154632 Added a new line | f6f56e8 (master) Mixed Reset |
| f915c7e Created a new file in Repo | 4154632 Added a new line |
|            |  f915c7e Created a new file in Repo |


After Creating new commit in base branch table looks like below

| Base Branch  | Feature Branch  |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| $ git log --oneline | $ git log --oneline |
| 181c359 (HEAD -> master) Commit from Master/base branch | 7841e52 (HEAD -> feature/abhi-test) This commit is in feature branch |
