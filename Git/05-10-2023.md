## Introduction to GIT.
- As devlopers are working in a project, there can be multiple modules which will combine together to make a single project
- Each Module contains specific requirements which need to be fullfilled
- when multiple developers are working on this module or project, we have combine every developers code into one place to create/run your code to make a application
- So, as developers are working on there invidual systems for the development of modules, we have to take care of all the code
- A signle module can take multiple days for the developement & their will be some enhancements need to be done after development.
- We have two type of sytems
    1. **Centralized System**
        - We have one main system which will be created in remote place and we will be create a **Repository** in that system
        - All the developers has to work in that **Repository** itself.
        - For every operation on centralized system you need to have internet connectivity
        - If internet connectivity is not there you can't do anything
        - If system breaks down/crashes all your code is wanished
        - As we are not maintaing any code locally we are with empty hands at the end of the day in your project
        `Ex: Google Form`
    2. **Distributed System**
        - This is simlar to centralized system where we will be maintaing our code in remore place
        - All the developers has to work on the same repository
        - But there is some process which you have to follow
        - 1st time you have to clone the remote repository so that a copy of remote code is maintained in your local system
        - We don't require internet connection conti to perform your actions
        - The main problem of crashing headache won't be there in distributed system, as a copy of remote repo with all the developers
        - When system crashes any one of the developers code can be pushed into remote repo to get back your complete code
        - But one thing we need to keep in mind that we have syncronize you local system code with remote repo frequently.
