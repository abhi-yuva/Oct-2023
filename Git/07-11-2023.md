## Git Cont...

### Different Changes WRT different files
- When you try to push your changes to the remote repo and if your remote repo is having early pushes before you do
- You will not be able to push your changes
- Because, your local repo and remote repo is not in sync.
- So, first you have to pull the changes from the remote repo to the local repo and once all the changes were reflected into your local sys, then you can push back your changes to the remote repo
- So when you pull your changes, you will be able to get all the changes from the remote repo to your local system
- As we are performing the chagnes in different files you will be lead into conflicts.

### Git Reflog
- `Reflog` is nothing but reference log information
- This Reflog will have all the activities we perform in our local repository and it will maintain all the actions with some commit id
- For every activity a commit id will be created and the operation name will be attached and will be stored in reflog for feature reference
- When we do some changes there may be a chance that you will be lost some of the commits, in those case this reflog will be very usefull
- To see the activity, the command is
```
git reflog
```
- The output will looks like this
```
$ git reflog
