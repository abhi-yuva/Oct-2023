## GIT cont...

### Is there any way to change Git Commit message with out modifiying content again?
#### Scenario
- I made some changes and did commit, while doing commit, commit message was wrongly spelt.
- I want to correct my commit message for the same changes
- Basically for every change there will be a new commit will be created
- As per the organization perspective you are not supposed to create a duplicate commit for the same changes and for the un-necessary changes.
- The repo should be clean and neat with the proper and related commits for the changes
- The solution for the above scenaior is

- We can use the below command to do the above taks
```
git commit --amend
```
Ex:
```
$ git commit -m "rmovd and added some changes"
[master 12cfae0] rmovd and added some changes
 2 files changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```
- In the above commit message we wrongly spelt `removed` word.
- I want to rectify that
- When we run `git commit --amend` it will open an editor and the below information it has
```
rmovd and added some changes

# Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting
# with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.

# On branch master
# Changes to be committed:
#       modified:   new-file.txt
#       modified:   secondfile.txt
#                                                                                                           ~                                                                                                              ~                                                                                                              ~                                                                                                              .git/COMMIT_EDITMSG [unix] (06:19 18/10/2023)
```
- To do any changes in that editor, we should be in insert mode. To be in insert mode you have to press `i`.
- When we press `i` the indicator will show as below `--INSERT--`
```
