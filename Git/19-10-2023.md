### How to configure SSH Keys
- Basically we will be cloning our repositories into our loacl system to work and push your changes
- To clone that we have an option and the recommended way is SSH connectivity
- Before cloning using this option we have to generate SSH Keys and that has to be configured
- While generating SSH keys we have 2 options of encryption
    1. RSA
    2. ED259 (Currently Amazon Linux 2023 Images will support this format)
- Below is the process to create SSH keys
    1. Create SSH Keys in your loacl system & it will generate 2 keys
        - Public Key
        - Private Key
    2. You have to copy your public key and paste it in your GIT Hub account to create connectivity

- There is an folder called ```know hosts```, first time it will try to register remote system information in your local system while transfering data to make sure this is the correct machine to proceed.
- To create SSH keys type the following command
```
ssh-keygen
```
- Once you type the above command it will ask you for the path and password. Dont pass any path or type any password. Just press enter 3 times and your keys will be generated.
- Below is the sample output of how ssh-keys are generated
```
$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/c/Users/<system-user>/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again:
```
> Note: <system-user> will be replaced with your system user name  

### Investigate ssh folder.
- When we go inside of that path of where ssh keys were generated you will be able to find the below folders
```
c/Users/<system-user>
$ cd .ssh/

c/Users/<system-user/.ssh>
$ ls
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub  known_hosts  known_hosts.old
```
- Below are the details of all the files
    1. id_rsa - Private Key
    2. id_rsa.pub - Public Key
    3. Known_hosts - List of systme informations which we have connected
    4. known_hosts.old - Backup of known_hosts
- To view any of the above files use `cat` command followed by the file name
```
cat id_rsa
cat know_hosts
```

### How to create SSH keys in Git-Hub
- In your Git-Hub account follow the below steps
    1. Go to Profile
    2. Click on Settings
    3. Click on SSH & GPG Keys
    4. Click on New SSH Key & type the following things
        1. Title
        2. Key type (Select Authentication Key)
        3. Key (Have to copy our public key here)
    5. Click on Add SSH Key
