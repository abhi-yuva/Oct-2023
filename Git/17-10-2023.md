## Git Cont...

- When we have hundreds of commits, it is not possible to go through all the commits with complete information
- As it is showing full details scrolling and finding our the commit which we are looking for is not simplest way
- So, for that in git we have anothere option to see logs in simplest way by using the below command
```
git log --oneline
```
- The output of `git log --oneline` looks like this
```
$ git log --oneline
4154632 (HEAD -> master) Added a new line
f915c7e Created a new file in Repo
```
- As we are just looking out the logs in a single line if I want to see what are the changes that was happend in a particular commit how to check?
- It will be possible with the help of below command
```
git show <commit-id>
```
- When we are looking at the `git show` command it will give you the following information
    1. Commit ID
    2. Author
    3. Time Stamp
    4. Commit Message
    5. Changes
- In git for every change it will have the following things
    1. No of changes (Existing modification/content in same line)
    2. No of additions (Creating new lines/files)
    3. No of deletions

- Sample git show command out as below
```
$ git show f915c7e

- While looking at the git show command or git log --oneline command if you think there are multiple lines exist press space to see the complete list
- Once you come to end press `q` to comout out of the output to the terminal mode
- Is there any option to look at the changes before doing commit?
- We have a command to look for changes before doing commit 
```
git diff
```
- This will show the changes which is similar to `git show <commit-id>`
- But the change is it will show you before commiting our changes
- Sample output of git diff as below
```
$ git diff
