## Jenkins

### What is Jenkins?
- Jenkins is an Automation tool which will be used for CI/CD (Cont Int, Cont Deliv, Cont Depl)
- Basically after creation/developing code for application you have pass your code into multiple stages
    - Packaging
    - Static Code Analysis
    - Artifactory
    - Creation of Environment
    - Deploying your code for Test Cases
    - Deploying your code in Production Environment
- All the above are the manual steps.
- Doing of all the above steps every day is not possible and it is not recommended way to do this one
- You have choose one platform where it will create all these steps in seq
- That is **Jenkins** which will create a *Pipeline* where you can automate all your stages of operations
- This pipeline will include the following things
    - Starting from taking the code from the developer to publish your code/package in multiple environments
    - Sending automated email notifications to the developer at the time of test case/analysis
    - Sending automated email notifications to the support team at the time of deployment your application in production
- We have 2 types of pipeline creations
    1. Scripted Pipeline
    2. Declarative Pipeline
